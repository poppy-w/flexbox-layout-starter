            <main>  I am a responsive website designer and developer with a passion for the details and cohesive content. I love to use branding sessions, photogrpahing the best parts of your business to draw customers in. When I am not designing beautiful websites for clients, you can find me reading, spending time with my dog, Scout, and baking up a storm. </main>

                I was born and raised in Santa Fe, New Mexico by a writer and an artist. I was exposed to a very creative lifestyle by my parents; color and words were always present in my home. I have lived in Seattle and Kansas City, but came back to Santa Fe because my love of New Mexico is so strong.

                My Passion: I love trying out new art mediums. I started out in the darkroom with black and white film photography in High School, while also getting my hands dirty in ceramics. I attended some printing and textile classes at the Kansas City Art Institute, and have continued to explore those and other creative outlets, such as collage and drawing.

                I worked as a restaurant worker for 6 years, where I have experience as a baker(my specialty is pie baking), a catering sous chef, and waitressing where I ended up as a floor manager at my last job. When I was laid off due to the pandemic, I decided to get back in touch with my creative roots and found my love for website design.
